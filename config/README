!
! Pipeline stage files define the title, description, and status values
! for each stage of a data processing pipeline. The number of stages is
! defined by the required key NSTAGE.
! 
! Each stage entry begins with the class STAGEnn where nn is a number between
! 01 and 99 (the number must be formatted as two digits) that indicates where
! a stage falls in the processing order (the first stage is 01, the second 02,
! and so on). Valid subclasses include:
!
! .TITLE        (required) a two character title for the stage
! .DESCRIPTION  (required) a short description for the stage
! .PROCESSnn    (optional; nn : 01 to 99) a process name for that stage
!
! (NOTE: all values containing spaces must be enclosed in single quotes)
!
! In addition, the characters that indicate the status of a dataset with
! respect to each stage are defined in this file. There are four subclasses
! to which a status character can be assigned to:
! 
! .CSTATUS.c    status indicates "complete" in this stage
! .TSTATUS.c    status indicates "trouble" in this stage
! .PSTATUS.c    status indicates "pending" in this stage
! .NSTATUS.c    status does not fall into any category
! 
! where c is the status character. The value for each of these entries
! should be a short description of its meaning. For example,
!
! STAGE01.CSTATUS.P = 'Processing dataset'
! STAGE01.TSTATUS.E = 'Fatal error while processing dataset'
! STAGE01.NSTATUS.W = 'Waiting for processing'
!
! Status characters must be categorized consistently across all stages; if
! a character is assigned as a CSTATUS for one stage, that same character
! cannot be assigned to TSTATUS, PSTATUS, or NSTATUS in another stage.
