! pmg_restrictions.dat
!
! This file is used to restrict the number of copies of certain processes
! that the PMG is allowed to start up.  Certain requirements dictate that
! only one copy of a process be allowed to run, so this file is a flexible
! method for enforcing that behavior through the PMG.
!
! The syntax of entries is:
!
! PROCESS.PATH.NODE = NUM_COPIES  (case insensitive)
!
!    where PROCESS    = name of pipeline process (same as resource filename)
!          PATH       = name of the path in which the restriction occurs
!          NODE       = name of the machine on which the restriction occurs
!          NUM_COPIES = number of copies of the process allowed
!
!    The "*" wildcard entry is allowed for the PATH and NODE components.
!
!	NOTE:  "*" wildcard does NOT work for processes!
!

!
!   NOTE:  these no longer work in the PMG for unknown reasons.  But they
!		do work in the script proc_man.pl.
